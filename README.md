# MNIST-Flask-EC2
Demo Project to deploy on EC2 for experimentation.

Code was cloned from this [repo](https://github.com/kartheek23/MnistDeploymentAWS.git) but edited to make compatible with latest versions of libraries as many of the functions & versions were either depreciated or weren't available through popular virtual environment frameworks i.e. conda, pip etc. 

Steps of deployment on EC2 were followed from this [article](https://medium.com/techfront/step-by-step-visual-guide-on-deploying-a-flask-application-on-aws-ec2-8e3e8b82c4f7).
